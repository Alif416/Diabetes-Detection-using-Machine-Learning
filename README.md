# 🩺 Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting diabetes in individuals using a structured dataset and applying machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, correlation analysis, feature transformation, and model training using Scikit-learn.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook appears to be `diabetes_dataset.csv`, which includes a variety of numerical and categorical features. Features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more are used to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook performs in-depth exploratory data analysis, including:

- Separation of **numerical** and **categorical** features.
- Visual inspection using **heatmaps** for correlation.
- Checking class **imbalance** in the target column `diabetes`.

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps are performed:

- **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical features.
- **Standard Scaling** for numerical features.
- Combining preprocessing steps using a **`ColumnTransformer`** and **`Pipeline`** from Scikit-learn.

---

## 🧠 Model Training

- The data is split into **training** and **testing** sets using `train_test_split`.
- The preprocessing pipeline is integrated directly into the model training workflow for streamlined operations.

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Correlation heatmaps for feature relationships.
- Class balance analysis.
- Feature distribution plots (if applicable).
